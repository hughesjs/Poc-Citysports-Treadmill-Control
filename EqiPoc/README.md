# Proof of Concept

This app represents a minimum viable controller for the treadmill.

It has these features:

- Start
- Stop
- Speed Up
- Speed Down
- Calories
- Speed
- Distance
- Time
- Steps

Hilariously, it's more functional than EqiSports because it displays the steps.

# Note

This code is not good. 

It's a proof of concept. 

It's not meant to be good. 

It's meant to be a proof of concept.

It just proves the protocol is correct (at least for my model).
